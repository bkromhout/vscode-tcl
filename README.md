# Tcl Syntax Highlighter for Visual Studio Code

Provides syntax highlighting for the Tcl language. Created after VS Code 1.37.0 broke the syntax highlighting provided by the other Tcl language extensions.

### Special Thanks

Special thanks goes to Chris Ainsley for creating [Iro](https://eeyo.io/iro/), "a development tool designed to simplify the creation of syntax highlighters across many platforms." Despite being in beta, it's incredibly stable and easy to use.
